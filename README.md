# CycleGAN

Simplified and documented implementation of [CycleGAN](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) in PyTorch. The datasets used can be found [here](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~taesung_park/CycleGAN/datasets/). A dataset must first be downloaded before running `main.py`. Additionally, the `img_dir` string in `main.py` must be modified accordingly.
